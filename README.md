# ComicWhisper
**Comic Whisper** is an educational puzzle game that challenges players and demonstrates knowledge of **optics and circuits** in solving a mystery to save the world. Players take on the role of scientists attempting to establish communication with an alien civilization orbiting a chaotic three-star system, drawing inspiration from the _Three-Body Problem_. To achieve this, they must overcome scientific challenges and successfully transmit a signal, which involves with **light absorption and transmission**, **spectroscopy**, **optical encoding (Morse code)**, and **light intensity modulation** to create an immersive learning experience, manipulating **light**, **sound**, and **electrical circuits** to complete each challenge. Through hands-on gameplay, **Comic Whisper** provides an engaging way to explore fundamental concepts in physics and electrical engineering. Developed as a **research project at UC San Diego under the supervision of Dr. Saharnaz**, the game blends scientific principles with interactive problem-solving.

## Materials Required
The game is built using a combination of **3D-printed components** and **electronic hardware**, including:
- **Optical Components:** Diffraction grating slide, light source (flashlight/light bulb), glass/plastic containers, laser pointers
- **Electronics & Sensors:** ESP32-CAM, ESP32, LEDs, IR LED, IR sensor, IR remote, LED strips, number pad, servo motor

## Game Logistics
Players must solve a series of **three interconnected puzzles** to complete their mission:

1. **Spectroscopy Challenge:** Identify the correct substances among a set of samples using a spectrometer and UV light. The correct substances reveal a password, allowing access to the next stage.
2. **Morse Code Decryption:** Observe the blinking LED sequences and decode the Morse code, converting it into binary and then base-10 numbers to unlock the second password.
3. **Signal Transmission Puzzle:** Align the signal tower (a laser pointer mounted on a servo motor) to the sun using the control panel, setting the correct coordinates. When the LED strips light up, it confirms the signal has been successfully transmitted, completing the game.
